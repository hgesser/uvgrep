v1.0.2 (2022-06-05)
  - add -x option that removes XML tags from output lines
  - use mktemp instead of tempfile, that is more portable
  - switch grep option -H (always with filename) to -h
    (no filename), because some versions of grep have started
    to color-highlight the filename
  - added .md extension to text files
  - added English error messages (displayed if LANG is not set
    or if it is set but does not start with "de")
